# My Project
================

A Python-based application designed to generate documentation for Streamlit applications.

## Description
-------------

My Project is a command-line tool built using the Python programming language. Its primary function is to automatically generate documentation for Streamlit applications. This project aims to simplify the process of creating and maintaining documentation for complex Streamlit projects.

## Features and Functionality
-----------------------------

*   **Streamlit Documentation Generation**: Automatically generates documentation for Streamlit applications.
*   **Customizable Output**: Allows users to customize the output format and structure of generated documentation.
*   **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Streamlit development workflows.

## Installation Instructions
---------------------------

To install My Project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher (recommended)
*   Streamlit installed on your system (`pip install streamlit`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository using Git:
    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
cd my-project
```
3.  Install required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Examples
-----------------

To use My Project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python streamlit_doc_generator.py --input-path /path/to/your/streamlit/app
```

Replace `/path/to/your/streamlit/app` with the actual path to your Streamlit application.

### Customizing Output

You can customize the output format and structure by passing additional arguments. For example, to generate documentation in Markdown format:

```bash
python streamlit_doc_generator.py --input-path /path/to/your/streamlit/app --output-format markdown
```

Refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference) for a comprehensive list of available options.

## File Structure Overview
-------------------------

The project consists of a single file: `streamlit_doc_generator.py`. This file contains 13 functions and 4 classes that work together to generate documentation for Streamlit applications.

### Code Organization

*   The `__main__` block at the end of the file handles command-line arguments and calls the main function.
*   Functions are organized into logical categories (e.g., input/output, parsing, generation).
*   Classes encapsulate related functionality and provide a structured approach to documentation generation.

## API Reference
-----------------

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--input-path` | Path to the Streamlit application directory. |
| `--output-format` | Output format (e.g., markdown, html). |

### Functions

*   `generate_documentation()`: Main function that orchestrates documentation generation.
*   `parse_streamlit_app()`: Parses the Streamlit application and extracts relevant metadata.
